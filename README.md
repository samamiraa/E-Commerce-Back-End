## Description

E-commerce backend built using sequalize, express, SQL and node. My motivation to complete this project was to learn how sequalize can simplify working with data with mySQL. I also learned how when paired with express, each route can be connected with SQL to accomplish different things.

## Installation

npm i express
npm i dotenv
npm i mysql2
npm install sequelize sqlite3

## Usage

After installing all required npm packages. First you will start by creating the database in the mySQL shell<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="create database" src="./assets/readmeimg/1 create database.png"><br>
<img width="1280" alt="create database confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/2 database created.png"><br>
<br>
Next in the terminal, you will need to seed the database by typing 'npm run seed' in the terminal<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="run seed" src="./assets/readmeimg/3 seed database.png"><br>
<img width="1280" alt="seed confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/4 seed confirmation.png"><br>
<br>
Once the database is seeded, next the server needs to start listening by typing 'node server.js' in the terminal<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="start server" src="./assets/readmeimg/5 start server.png"><br>
<img width="1280" alt="server started confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/6 server started.png"><br>
<br>
Once the server is started, open up insomnia or postman. In my project, I used insomnia to test my routes. The first test is to show what happens when you input a route that is not defined.<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="wrong route" src="./assets/readmeimg/7 wrong route.png"><br>
<br>
The first route is a get request to find all the categories in the database<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find all categories" src="./assets/readmeimg/8 find all categories.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a get requst to find one category by its id<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find one category" src="./assets/readmeimg/9 find one category.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a post request to create a new category<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="create category" src="./assets/readmeimg/10 create category.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a put request to update an existing category<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="update category" src="./assets/readmeimg/11 update category.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a delete request to delete an existing category<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete category" src="./assets/readmeimg/12 delete category.png"><br>
<br>
Next to confirm the category has been deleted, a get request to find the deleted category by its previous id will show a message saying the category does not exist<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/13 category does not exist.png"><br>
<br>
Next are the test for the routes belonging to the products table. First route is a get request to find all existing products included in this search are tags associated with this product and which category the products belong to<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find all products" src="./assets/readmeimg/14 find all products.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a get request to find one product by its id<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find one product" src="./assets/readmeimg/15 find one product.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a post request to create a new product<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="create product" src="./assets/readmeimg/16 create new product.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a put request to update an existing product<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="update product" src="./assets/readmeimg/17 update product.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a delete request to delete an existing product<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete product" src="./assets/readmeimg/18 delete product.png"><br>
<br>
And finally, when you go back to do a get request to find one product by id, you can search that deleted product by its previous id and a message is displayed saying the product does not exist<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete product confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/19 product does not exist.png"><br>
<br>
The last test routes are for the tags table. The first route is a get request to find all existing tags, included in the search are any existing products that have that tag<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find all tags" src="./assets/readmeimg/20 find all tags.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a get request to find a tag by its id<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="find one tag" src="./assets/readmeimg/21 find one tag.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a post request to create a tag<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="create tag" src="./assets/readmeimg/22 create tag.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a put request to update an existing tag<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="update tag" src="./assets/readmeimg/23 update tag.png"><br>
<br>
The next route is a delete request to delete an existing tag<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete tag" src="./assets/readmeimg/24 delete tag.png"><br>
<br>
And finally, when you go back to do a get request to find one¬†tag by id, you can search that deleted tag by its previous id and a message is displayed saying the tag does not exist<br>
<br>
<img width="1280" alt="delete tag confirmation" src="./assets/readmeimg/25 tag does not exist.png"><br>
