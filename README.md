# E-Commerce-Back-End

Walkthrough Videoüëáüèº<br>

## Description

E-commerce backend built using sequalize, express, SQL and node. My motivation to complete this project was to learn how sequalize can simplify working with data with mySQL. I also learned how when paired with express, each route can be connected with SQL to accomplish different things.
